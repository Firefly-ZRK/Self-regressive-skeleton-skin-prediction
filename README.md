# Self-regressive-skeleton-skin-prediction
This scheme employs a two-stage process to achieve the automatic binding of 3D human point clouds. In the first stage, a hierarchical autoregressive model predicts the skeleton: it first predicts 22 main joints, and then refines this with a hand refinement module that predicts 30 finger joints, totaling 52 joints, to leverage the interdependencies between joint points and enhance hand precision. The second stage involves skinning weight prediction: the predicted skeleton is input along with the original point cloud into a multi-layer cross-attention network, integrating a hand perception module that applies differentiated attention strategies to various joints, while introducing skeletal equivalence training to address the weight distribution issues in detailed areas such as the hands and toes, thereby enhancing the realism of the skinning.
